# solution_tasks-java-oop_topic
**In this repository are located solutions to tasks written in the Java programming language on the topics of using OOP paradigm.**  

Under the notion that the task relates to the OOP topic, it is understood that such constructs and basic concepts as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation, composition, delegation, methods of the Object class, constructors, reloading, static context, abstract types are presented and used in the task data, interfaces, enumerations, inner and nested classes, lambda expressions, generics, etc.  

The hierarchy (nesting) of packets is based on the classical packet structure, which is used in BAT Maven.  

The name of the packages in which the classes are located to solve the problem is the approximate condition of the task.  

A complete description of the task you can see in the package with the solution of the problem in a file with the same name and file extension .txt  .
