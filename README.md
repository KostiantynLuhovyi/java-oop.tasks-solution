**The package name and description of the solved task that are contained in the root package com.lugowoy.tasks :**  

* `calculationOfAmountOfPaintNeededToPaintRoom`  
    * _Enter the length, width and height of the room.
       Calculate how much paint will go to painting the walls of this room,
       if there are N liters of paint per 1 m2 of wall and M% of the wall surface is occupied by windows and doors.
       Also, calculate the total cost of paint, taking into account that one liter of paint costs R UAH._  
* `calculationOfVariousDataAboutPlanetsOfSolarSystem`  
    * _Calculate the total mass of all the planets of the solar system.
       Calculate the arithmetic mean of the masses of the planets.
       Then - the mass of each planet in percentages, if we take as 100% the total mass of all the planets._  
* `determineSuitabilityOfComponent`  
    * _The suitability of the component is estimated by the size B, which must correspond to the interval (A - N, A + N).
       Calculate the number of suitable and unusable components._  
* `determiningProfitableExchangeOfCurrencyInBank`  
    * _Identify the bank from the available for the most beneficial exchange of selected currencies and amounts._  
* `programForCalculatingStudentRequiredFundsForLiving`  
    * _Monthly student stipend is N UAH, and living expenses exceed the stipend and make M UAH per month.
       The price increase monthly increases expenses by 3%.
       Make a program for calculating the amount of money that you need to ask at a time from your parents so that you can live an academic year (10 months),
        using only this money and a stipend._  
* `writeProgramToGetNumberOfMostFrequentAnswersInQuizAndTheirPercentages`
